# Degabut Youtube

A simple standlone YouTube API for Degabut

---

**This package has been deprecated, Degabut's YouTube API is now integrated with [Degabut's core app](https://github.com/degabut/degabut)** by passing these env variable:
```
YOUTUBE_API_PORT=
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

This allows you to run Youtube API and the core app within the same Node process to save some memory if memory usage is critical.
